Task 1: Chat with PDF Using RAG Pipeline 
Overview 
The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to 
interact with semi-structured data in multiple PDF files. The system should extract, chunk, 
embed, and store the data for e icient retrieval. It will answer user queries and perform 
comparisons accurately, leveraging the selected LLM model for generating responses.

In colab its working fine and the link is provide below

Task 2: Chat with Website Using RAG Pipeline 
Overview 
The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to 
interact with structured and unstructured data extracted from websites. The system will crawl, 
scrape, and store website content, convert it into embeddings, and store it in a vector database. 
Users can query the system for information and receive accurate, context-rich responses 
generated by a selected LLM.
